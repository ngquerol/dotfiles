# Dotfiles

This is where I keep my dotfiles for backup purposes. Currently it contains dotfiles for:

* (G)vim (which I now use more than Emacs, we'll see how it goes)
* AwesomeWM
* Emacs
* Ncmpcpp
* Various terminal color schemes
* Zsh

... And there's probably more to come. Pull requests are welcome!
