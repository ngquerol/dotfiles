# Dotfiles

This is where I keep my dotfiles for backup purposes. Currently it contains dotfiles for:

* Emacs
* (G)vim (which I now use more than Emacs, we'll see how it goes)
* Zsh
* AwesomeWM
* Mutt
* Various terminal color schemes

... And there's probably more to come. Pull requests are welcome!
